# Introduction to `SpaDES`

## Package description

Easily implement a variety of simulation models, with a focus on spatially explicit models.
These include raster-based, event-based, and agent-based models.
The core simulation components are built upon a discrete event simulation framework that facilitates modularity, and easily enables the user to include additional functionality by running user-built simulation modules.
Included are numerous tools to rapidly visualize raster and other maps.

## Requirements

This packages makes heavy use of the `raster` [@raster:2015] and `sp` [@sp:2005; @sp:2013] packages, so familiarity with these packages, their classes and methods is recommended.
