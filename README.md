# SpaDES Workshops

This web site is *very much* in development. You can follow progress with the links above.

For those of you following the Developer's workshop, you can pre-install the `SpaDES` packages:

```
update.packages(oldPkgs = c("quickPlot", "reproducible", "SpaDES.core")); 
install.packages("SpaDES") 

```
