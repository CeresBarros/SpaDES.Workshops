## Loops

- A fundamental unit of computer programs is the loop
- Used in virtually every computer language
- However, with *R* and `SpaDES`, there are 2 reasons not to:

    - They are somewhat slow
    - They don't allow easy sharing of code
  
## Loops in time

- Some loops are used where *time* is the object moving forward
- If one loop iteration depends on the previous loop iteration 
- Called a **Markov Chain**

```{r}
age <- 1
for (time in 1:10) {
  age <- age + 1
}
```

## Events

- Rather than "iterating", we can think of "events"
- Spring thaw

- Brainstorm events...

## Events instead of loops

- Rather than `for ...`, we **schedule** the next event:

```{r events-into-loops}
age <- 1
aging <- age + 1

# define event
doEvent("aging")
scheduleEvent("aging", 1)

runEvents(start = 1, end = 10)

```
