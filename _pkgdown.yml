  - title: "Day 1 - SpaDES at Work"
    desc: >
      Here we present some of the projects that used SpaDES and its tools
    contents:
    - 10a-LandWeb

    - 10c-Harvesting

  - title: "Day 1 - SpaDES in Action: a forest succession, a wildfire models, and a caribou models -- putting it all together"
    desc: >
      Here we present two models that we use for forest succession (`LandR`) and wildfire (`SCFM`).
      This is an example of module integration using SpaDES

  - title: "Day 2 - Basic concepts to get you started: using SpaDES in Action for examples"
    desc: >
      Now we will use the SpaDESinAction example to understand how SpaDES works. These are the topics we will cover:\n
      1. Module's and global scripts\n
      2. Libraries and options\n
      3. Setting Paths\n
      4. Project structure\n
      5. Time\n
      6. Parameters\n
      7. Objects\n
      8. Modules\n
      9. SimInit and the simList\n
      10. `spades()`\n
      11. Events* (this will be addressed after break with exercises)\n
      12. Checking your outputs
