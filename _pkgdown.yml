  - title: "Day 1 - SpaDES at Work"
    desc: >
      Here we present some of the projects that used SpaDES and its tools
    contents:
    - 10a-LandWeb
    - 10b-NWT
    - 10c-Harvesting

  - title: "Day 1 - SpaDES in Action: a forest succession, a wildfire models, and a caribou models -- putting it all together"
    desc: >
      Here we present two models that we use for forest succession (`LandR`) and wildfire (`SCFM`).
      This is an example of module integration using SpaDES
    contents:

        # --> Go deeper into LandR
        # --> Go back and go deeper into SCFM
        # --> Go back and go deeper into caribou
        # Live action: Rstudio Show how them running integrated in a small area

  - title: "Day 2 - Basic concepts to get you started: using SpaDES in Action for examples"
    desc: >
      Now we will use the SpaDESinAction example to understand how SpaDES works. These are the topics we will cover:
      1. Module's and global scripts
      2. Libraries and options
      3. Setting Paths
      4. Project structure
      5. Time
      6. Parameters
      7. Objects
      8. Modules
      9. SimInit and the simList
      10. `spades()`
      11. Events* (this will be addressed after break with exercises)
      12. Checking your outputs
