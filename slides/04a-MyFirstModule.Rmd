<!-- TODO: reduce overlap between this and the 'loops to events' vignette -->

## Loops: what are they and why use them?

- fundamental programming units (most languages have them)
- used to repeat a set of instructions, without "duplicating" code
- often used in ecology to iterate something over "time"
  + usually, each 'time-step' depends on the previous one. Note in the examples below, how we start an `age` object at 1, and increment it at each step of `time`, or `t`. In both cases `time` and `t` are the loop *counters*, but only in the second case is the counter being effectively "used" inside the loop.

## Loop example in R

```{r loop_example}
age <- 1
for (time in 1:10) {
  age <- age + 1
}
```

- **initialise** a storage vector
- define time **boundaries**
- define the **increment**
- define the **content** (what's done)

## From loops to events

- In R, we try to avoid loops because:
  + they are slow
  + they make code harder to share amongst users

## From loops to events

- It's easy to think about "events" in ecology

In SpaDES, events are first *defined*, then *scheduled* to happen at a particular point in time:

## Events in `SpaDES`

```{r loopsToEvents}
## initialisation
age <- 1                              

## boundaries
times = list(start = 1, end = 10) 

## event definition (content)
aging <- function(age) {
  age <- age + 1                
}

## event execution and scheduling
events <- {
  doEvent("aging")
  scheduleEvent("aging", when = now + 1)
}
```

## Events in `SpaDES`

- Event execution and scheduling in `SpaDES` use same components of a for-loop: **initialize**, **bounds**, **step**, **content**

- This creates an *event queue*

## What would that sequence look like?

1. what is happening now
2. What are the next thing(s) in the queue

```{r}
#     eventTime moduleName  eventType
#  1:         0       loop       init
#  2:         0       loop addOneYear
#  3:         1       loop addOneYear
#  4:         2       loop addOneYear
#  5:         3       loop addOneYear
#  6:         4       loop addOneYear
#  7:         5       loop addOneYear
#  8:         6       loop addOneYear
#  9:         7       loop addOneYear
# 10:         8       loop addOneYear
# 11:         9       loop addOneYear
# 12:        10       loop addOneYear 
```

## Why contain the iterated code in a function?

- iterated code remains isolated from execution and scheduling - cleaner, more organised
- easier to share
- easier to change and update - modular!
